    <h1 class="title">COME VISIT NYC!</h1>
    <p class="intro">New york became a main entry point for Europe during
        the 19th century. Many europeans began to flood into New york,
        including a lot of irish because of the "Great Famine". The statue
        of Liberty was opened during 1886, and was a ray of hope for the people.
        New york was extremely popular, and the skyscrapers that were developed
        brought the city to life! During the late 1970's up until now, New york
        is one of the most popular places that many want to migrate to, and make a
        living in. <a href="#businfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
