        Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperature seasons, succeeding winter and preceeding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, culture and customs. When it is spring in the Northern hemisphere, it is autumn in the southern hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring or (vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses until the summer solastice in June (Northern Hempishere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).

        Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation. renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have lcimates better described in ter sof other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.
